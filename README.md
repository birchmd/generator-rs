# Generators in Rust

Implements a basic interface for [generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine#Generators) using the `tokio` library in Rust.
The Rust language has [built-in support for generators](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/language-features/generators.html), but it is currently unstable.
